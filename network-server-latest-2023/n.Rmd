-Reliability: reaction of layer to lost/corrupted block of data. Types
of services:

-   unacknowledged connectionless service
    acknowledged connectionless service
    acknowledged connection-oriented service.

-Link layer protocols ensure communication between neighboring
devices:**-framing, -link access.**

**-Bit error rate (BER)** - number of bit errors per unit time

\-**CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**

\-"bandwidth Ã— delay---influences the selection of frame acknowledgment
and resend methods.

-Link Layer(data transfer between "neighboring" devices) Sublayers

-   **MAC (Medium Access Control)** -- controls the access to shared
    medium, defines frame address (MAC address)

    -   Random Access Methods:

        -   **ALOHA**: whenever a sender has data, it transmits, in case
            error (higher layer), sender retransmits his message after
            some random time
            **Slotted ALOHA**: time is slotted and a packet can only be
            transmitted at the beginning of one slot
            **CSMA(Carrier *Sense* Multiple Access)**: before the
            station starts transmission, it listens to the link. if
            channel is idle, station transmits && if channel is not
            idle, three variants:

            -   1-persistent: wait for finish and send right away with
                probability 1
            -   non-persistent: wait for random time
            -   p-persistent: wait until the next slot and send with
                probability p

        -   **CSMA with CD(collision detect)**: same with CSMA, just if
            collision stop. (could not listen during transmitting)
            **CSMA with CA(collision avoidance)**:(RTS-CTS: station- RTS
            -- Request To Send packet......central- CTS -- Clear To
            Send)

-   **LLC (Logical Link Control)** -- supports the coexistence of
    different network layer protocols in the same link, flow control and
    error control

\-**Frames**: Stream of bits is divided into frames.....byte stuffing:
start and stop flags

\-**collision**: a situation where two or more wireless devices transmit
data simultaneously, resulting data packets overlapping each other

\-**AP (Access Point)**: a (central hub)device that enables wireless
devices to connect and communicate with each other/a wired network

-WiFi: authentication protocols:- free access (no authentication): -WEP,
--WPA, WPA2

\-**Bluetooth: PAN (Personal Area Networks)**

\-**VLAN = Virtual Local Area Network**- They are designed to be able to
separate flows in networks at the link layer. implemented using tagged
frames. VLAN division:

-   By **ports** -- a specific VLAN is selected according to which
    specific ports on the switch are assigned to it (can be used for
    smaller networks). By **addresses** -- a specific frame is assigned
    to a specific VLAN group according to the link(MAC) address. By
    **protocol** -- the frame is assigned to a specific VLAN according
    to the higher layer protocol it transmits (eg voice, video, etc.).
    By **tag** -- by attaching a tag to a frame (most common today), it
    is commonly referred to as a tagged vlan. Multiple (VLAN within
    VLAN, Q-in-Q)

\-**IP = Internet Protocol**

\-**ICMP = Internet Control Message Protocol**-send error/information
messages

-The mechanism for finding a path between a source and a destination
station is called **routing**

-Network layer

-   connectionless services, connection-oriented services,

-   their diff--------
    **path registration** \| no yes
    **addressing** \| src/dest addr label
    **state information on the router** \| no yes
    **routing** \| individual only during the path registration
    **router failure** \| small problem big problem
    **QoS & flow control** \| difficult easy
    **congestion control** \| difficult easy

-Types of addressing:

-   **unicast**(dest-1 host)
    **broadcast**(dest-all hosts in local)
    **anycast**(dest-1 host in group)
    **multicast**(dest-groups of hosts)

    -   **IGMP protocol** (Internet Group Management Protocol) for hosts
        registration
        **PIM protocol** (Protocol Independent Multicast) for multicast
        routing

-IPv4 address:

-   **CIDR schema** (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) -- RFC1518,
    RFC1519. network prefix length is arbitrary
    **Private IP address**: free to use in private networks

\-**Fragmentation**: by MTU (Maximal Transmission Unit),packet with
length \> MTU will be divided to more smaller packets

\-**ARP**-Address Resolution Protocol-resolution of network layer
addresses into link layer addresses

-IPv6 header: changes

-   **omitted**:fragmentation, options: replaced by extension headers
    header length: is fixed now checksum: get rid of recalculation on
    each router

-   **New field**:Flow label (20b) -- identification of data flow to
    make routing easier

-Types of IPv6 addresses-

-   individual: **unicast** group: **multicast** selective: **anycast**

-IPv6 network ranges-

-   ::1/128 - loopback fc00::/7 - unique local addresses (local network
    range) fe80::/10 - link local range ff00::/8 - multicast 2000::/3 -
    global addresses 2001:db8::/32 - used for documentation and
    illustration purposes

\-**Jumbogram**: IPv6 allows larger packet -- jumbogram -- up to 4 GB

**-Fragmentation**: minimal MTU for IPv6 is 1280 bytes, performed by
sender.

\-**Neighbor Discovery Protocol**: extended replacement for ARP, uses
ICMPv6...find out link addresses in the local network && routers
discovery

\-**MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS)**:adds label to layer 3 packets
& implements end-to-end connection independent of link layer

\-**MPLS network**:Label Edge Router(LER) attaches label to packet when
it enters MPLS network, inside the MPLS network, packets are forwarded
according labels by LabelSwitch Routers(LSRs),when packet exits the MPLS
network, the edge router removes the label

\-**DHCP service(statefull-auto network configuration):** (we have one
more -dhcp is not connected for stateless(link-local))

-   Client - discovery Server - offer Client - request Server -
    acknowledgment

\-**Path** = the sequence of routers that a packet must pass between a
source and a destination station.

-If the routing tables on the routers have to be set manually, this is
**static routing**. When routing tables autonomously configure routing
protocols during operation, this is **dynamic routing**.

-Types of routing:

-   Optimal(metric)

    -    **shortest path**, number of intermediate routers.
        **the cheapest** (different routes have different costs).

-   **Redundant** (multi-path): The router chooses one path based on a
    certain criterion

    -    Traffic can be conducted in different ways. It is suitable for
        backing up trips or load sharing.

-   By symmetry

    -    **symmetrical** (forward and reverse paths are the same).
        **asymmetric** (not symmetrical, e.g. satellite systems..
        affects packet delivery time).

-   According to the way-finding method

    -   **flood** (simplest, but many technologies and protocols use
        them). The request is provided with an identifier (ID), to
        prevent loop
        **proactive** (path is calculated in advance and stored in the
        routing tables).
        **reactive** (path is created only when needed) adhoc/mobile
        networks (variable topology).

-   According to the route calculation area

    -   **Internal** (within one network).OSPF, RIP protocols
        **External** (between different networks).BGP protocol

\-**ISP- Internet Service Provider**, connection provider with assigned
specific IP ranges.

-Typical routing table entry entries

-   **Destination**: IP (destination city analogy).
    **Gateway**: IP (an analogy to the next signpost on the
    route).Gateway 0.0.0.0 means it\'s a local network
    **Mask/GenMask**: by prefix (analogy: area)..
    **Flag**:\-\--
    **Metric**: price (analogy: distance in km).
    **Interface**: name (analogy: entrance to the road).

-Routing tables can be configured manually (statically)-not able to
respond to changes. or dynamically-quickly respond.... types of dynamic
routing algorithms

-   **Distance Vector Algorithms** (DVA)-to optimize uses Distributed
    version of Bellman-Ford Algorithm (DBFA-used in RIP = Routing
    Information Protocol.).
    **Link State Algorithms** (LSA)-used Dijkstra\'s algorithm (DA) ,
    protocol OSPF = Open Shortest Path First, IS-IS (Intermediate System
    to Intermediate System) protocol.. LSAs are less demanding on the
    link load due to data exchange
    **Path Vector Algorithms** (PVA)-using **BGP = Border Gateway
    Protocol**(BGP is used primarily for external routing). metric of a
    particular path-VH = vector of values. Between neighboring edge
    routers, data is delivered using the link layer

\-**Link (L):** connection of two neighboring routers (X and Y) with a
certain cost (C).

\-**EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**:advanced
distance-vector routing protocol. synchronizes routing tables at
startup, sends specific updates only when topology changes occur to
multicast address 224.0.0.10

\-**Autonomous System (AS):** Group of all IP address ranges of a
specific ISP. Each AS has its own specific identifier. Identifiers are
used for external routing

-   An AS receiving traffic only for its internal stations is referred
    to as **non-transient,** An AS forwarding traffic intended for a
    station belonging to another AS through its internal network is
    called **transient**.

\-**Sample BGP routing table**:

-   **Network** = target network
    **AS PATH** = path to destination
    **network, L(AS PATH)** = path length.
    **MED, LocPrf, Weight** - various attributes of the metric value
    vector.
    Rule: Weight \> LocPrf \> MED \> L(AS PATH), i.e. if two paths to
    one destination have the same e.g. Weight, the decision is further
    made according to LocPrf.

-Transport layer:

-   reliability
    flow control
    data segmentation
    correction of errors

-   **Connection establishment**: three-way handshake: CONNECTION
    REQUEST, ACKNOWLEDGE,
    DATA.....conntect(-\>)-\>accept(\<-)-\>data(-\>)-\>accept(\<..-)

-   **Connection termination: asymmetric** **termination**(one user
    terminates the connection , possible data loss when the other user
    sent data before receiving termination message), **symmetric
    termination**(both sides must agree, there is no fully reliable
    solution if communication is not secured) FIN(-\>)-\>ack(\<-)..half
    closed. FIN(\<-)-\>ack(-\>) total close

\-**TSAP -- Transport Service Access Point** port 80 for http

-The minimum transmitted unit is referred to as a **segment.**

\-**TCP-Transmission Control Protocol**- connection-oriented, guarantees
error free data transmission, duplex. **data delivery guarantee**:
checksum, detection of duplicate packets, retransmission, correct
ordering, timeout, good for applications which need reliable data
channel

-   **Sliding window**: receiver reserves buffer, receiver specifies the
    current window size in the reply

-   **Acknowledgement**: receiver sends ACK, where is the sequence
    number of the byte, which is expected. if a packet does not arrive,
    but the following does, receiver repeats the last ACK it will
    indicate the packet might have been lost

-   **MSS (Maximum Segment Size)** -- maximum size of the packet to be
    sent, defined by the receiver

-   **SSTHRESH (Slow-start Threshold)** -- limit for likely congestion

-   **CWND (Congestion Window)** -- sender window.

**Congestion Control**:-slow start initial CWND 1,congestion window size
is increased 2x: grows exponentially....packet or its acknowledgment is
lost, if ACK did not come at all (timeout), is duplicate ACK comes 3x:

\-**UDP(User Datagram Protocol):** connection-less, UDP datagram may be
lost, used where packet losses are not be critical (eg. DNS)

\-**RTP(Real-time Transport Protocol)**UDP**:** streaming data between
endpoints in real time. header contains \"timestamp\".

\-**RTP Control Protocol- RTCP:** provides statistics and control
information for an RTP session, does not transport any media data
itself, used to control quality of service

**-Domain Name System (DNS):** a system primarily intended for
translating domain names into IP addresses. load sharing, access
restriction. DNS runs on port 53 by default

\-**DNSSEC** :secure DNS extension to prevent response forgery.

\-**Name Server (NS):** a computer that takes care of translating
domain names to IP addresses.

\-**DNS Server** = NS working in the DNS system.

\-**Domain =** a set of different domain records grouped under a common
domain name

\-**Resolver**: a program that communicates with the Name server by
sending a request to translate a domain name to the corresponding IP
address.

-DNS servers that manage RRs for specific domains are called
**authoritative DNS servers** for those domains.translation:
-**directly**(ip-\>domain), -**reverse**(opposite)

-Root DNS servers = Level 0 DNS servers.13 groups are there.

-Four types of TLD domains:

-   **Generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs)**
    The **3-character code** indicates the function of the organization
    using this domain. Primarily used in the US. .... gov, mil, edu,
    org, com, net.
    **Country Code Top Level Domain (ccTLD)**
    I The **2-character code** indicates the state in which the servers
    listed in the RRs of the given domain are typically located: cz, us,
    va, jp, de.
    **New Generic Top Level Domains (ngTLD)**
    The domain name can be any string.
    This is how they mark e.g. cities .paris, .london, etc.
    **Reverse domain in-addr.arpa**
    Designed for converting an IP address to a domain name

\-**Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)**: concatenation of domain name
into one string '.' for separation. limited to 63 characters(specific
level).overall 255 character.

\-**Zone**: a specific subset of a set of domain names.

\-**Zone Record** = SOA Record.{RRs}

\-**SOA record**: record containing basic general information about the
given zone. Only one exists.

\-**Domain resource record**: a record containing specific information
for a specific domain name. There are usually several mutually different
RRs.

-The **general form of RR** is (Name, TTL, Class, Type, Value)

-   **Name** = domain name of the given server.
    **TTL** = time in seconds, how long the RR can be stored in the
    cache of DNS servers, after which it must be loaded again. If the
    TTL is not specified in the record, it is taken as the MINIMUM value
    from the SOA record.
    **Class** = the protocol family to which the record relates
    (commonly IN, IN = Internet, other classes exist but are not used).
    **Type** = determination of the type of record.
    **Value** = IP address or domain name.

-   **Selected types of RR**: **A** - IPv4 domain name
    **AAAA** = IPv6 domain name.
    **NS**= authoritative DNS server
    **MX** = server handles email delivery
    **CNAME** = canonical name
    **PTR** = reverse record of IP address
    **SRV** = server providing VOIP
    **TXT** = Text comment
    **CAA** = Certificate authorities
    **RRSIG** = public key to verify given record, uses DNSSEC extension
    record

\-**DNS protocol** = a protocol that is used for sending queries and
responses in the DNS
system. transmitted in the DATA item of a UDP or TCP packet. uses port
53

-The DNS server sends DNS queries distributedly, in two ways:
**iteratively** or **recursively**.

-   An **iterative DNS server** that resolves a domain name to an IP
    address is
    querying step by step. It starts at the root DNS server and moves
    down
    one level at each step.
    **Recursive way of querying** in DNS: here root dns servre request
    TLD or authoritative DNS recursively.
    **Reverse query** = a query whose task is to find out the domain
    name for a given IP address.The reverse query for the IP AA.BB.CC.DD
    is formulated as a direct query for the domain name
    DD.CC.BB.AA.in-addr.arpa.

**-Dynamic DNS- DynDNS server**: DNS server that can change A records
for
domain names according to station instructions on the fly.(checking ip
address regularly)

\-**DNSSEC** = secure DNS where the authenticity of the response can be
verified. Each DNS server signs its response with its private key. Using
the public key, which is stored in the RRSIG record on the DNS server of
the parent domain, it is possible to verify the authenticity of the
answer.

\-**DNS and load balancing**: The principle is that when the same domain
name is requested repeatedly, the authoritative DNS server returns a
different IP address each time.

\-**Attack on DNS - Cache Poisoning**: when the DNS server detects the
translation, the attacker generates a response that contains the
identical response ID and the spoofed IP address. Since the response
from the attacker arrives earlier than from the authoritative DNS
server, the DNS server forwards the attacker\'s response to the user and
stores it in its cache memory.

\-**Attacker** = an Internet user who, on his own or through special
programs or hardware, carries out attacks against other users.

-Computer **network security technologies**

-   **Firewall
    IPS/IDS
    Honeypot
    Scrubbing center**

\-**Firewall** = a device that controls, passes, filters, or modifies
network traffic coming to the inbound network interface. The specific
firewall activity for a specific type of network traffic is defined by
firewall rules.

-Types of firewalls:

-   **Packet(network)**
    Evaluate network traffic based on the source and destination IP
    addresses of the packet. More advanced firewalls also perform
    detailed in-depth analysis of individual packet headers and data,
    the so-called **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI).** DPI is not
    applicable to encrypted protocols, such as HTTPS.
    Unencrypted protocols can be identified by specific strings.
    **State(transport)**
    Throughput rates are comparable to packet firewalls.
    In advanced security systems, they are used with **Intrusion
    Prevention Systems (IPS)**.
    **proxy(application layer)**
    Devices or programs that control and forward traffic between the
    source station and the destination server. communication via the
    application layer protocol.

\-**Signatures**: specific unique strings (fingerprints) of characters
enabling the identification of headers of specific protocols with high
probability.

\-**DEEP Packet Inspection (DPI)**: DPI firewalls have so-called
signatures defined for selected protocols, on the basis of which they
recognize the protocols.

\-**Packet firewall operation**: Firewalls perform specific actions on
packets based on predefined rules. The well-known Linux packet firewall
is called **iptables** (the newer version is called nftables).

-iptables - **chains of rules for working with packets**:

-   **PREROUTING** = chain related to all packets before making a
    routing decision based on the packet\'s destination IP address.
    **POSTROUTING** = chain related to all packets after routing
    decision is made based on the destination IP address of the packet.
    **FORWARD** = chain related only to packets that are forwarded.
    **INPUT** = chain only for packets that are intended for local
    applications.
    **OUTPUT** = chain related only to packets that are generated by
    local applications.

-iptables distinguish three basic rule tables:

-   **filter** = enable or disable packet delivery.
    **nat** = translation of IP addresses or ports in the packet header.
    **mangle** = edit items in the packet header for further processing.

\-**Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)**: part of a network that is accessible
from the external network (Internet). It makes a certain service
available to any users, such as websites/mail forwarding.

\-**Intranet**: internal part of the network that is accessible only to
authorized users, e.g., file sharing server, non-public websites.

\-**Application firewall** = firewall communicating through specific
application protocol.

\-**Application firewall (proxy)**: used for hiding the source IP
address, reducing the amount of outbound traffic. AF copies the request,
sets up itself as the originator of the request, and contacts the
destination server (DS).

-I**ntrusion Detection System (IDS)**: If a threat is detected, it
informs the administrator, who will take action to eliminate the threat.

\-**Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**: If a threat is detected, the
IPS sends an instruction to the Firewall requesting activation or
generation of a rule

\-**Honeypot** (demilitarized zone)= a device that serves as bait for an
attacker in order to obtain information about attacker. gives the
impression of running network service.The attacker who discovers the
honeypot tries to attack it and it stores their info.

\-**Scrubbing center** = a group of devices filtering a portion of
network traffic that shows signs of various network attacks. Filtration
phases:2 router. 1 for unfiltered, 1 for filtered.

\-**Port scanning** = discovery of services running on a given computer.
performed by establishing a connection (TCP). If the station responds to
requests sent to the destination port, we speak of an **open port**,
otherwise a **closed port**.

-   **Horizontal**: scans a specific port with different IP
    addresses(pcs).
    **Vertical**: scans multiple ports with a single IP address(pc).

\-**Password cracking** - the attack takes place via terminal services
(SSH, RDP, TELNET)

-   **Brute force attack**: tries all possible combinations of
    characters.
    **Dictionary attack**: uses a predefined list of passwords that used
    frequently.

\-**Denial of Service (DOS)** = attack implemented to prevent access to
the service.(send many ICMP queries, opening many TCP connections)

-   **Distributed DOS (DDOS)**: DOS version run from different infected
    computers.(The attacker first attacks and controls several computers
    and attacks)
    **Reflected/Spoofed DOS (RDOS)**: The source IP address in the IP
    packet header is spoofed and used for sending many ICMP requests and
    therefore difficult to identify the attacker.

-exploit specific security vulnerabilities : Malicious applications that
perform this type of attack are called **worms**. **attack Buffer
overflow** = overwriting a specific area of main memory triggers a
specific action

\- **Sending spam**: attack by content is **Phishing** = an attack to
capture a user\'s identity by opening a link to a fake login page.

\-**Malware**: The application then performs specific actions without
the user\'s knowledge.

-   **Trojan horse** :behaves like a normal legitimate application, but
    contains malicious code.
    **Ransomware** = malware that encrypts the contents of the hard
    disk.
    **Spyware** = malware that tries to read various user information.
    **Adware** = malware that displays advertising offers.

\-**VPN-Virtual Private Network**.The task of a VPN is to make the local
network or its part available to user who is by network geographically
separated from it.

-   **Intranet** - within the same network of one organization.
    **Extranet** - allow access for an authorized set of customers to
    subset of services.
    **Remote Access** - connection of a certain employee to the company.

\-**Access/VPN Server** = access server that mediates remote access to
user connected via a data/telephone line.
**VPN Device** = device that is used to connect a local network to
surrounding networks via VPN. VPN protocols are used for communication.
**VPN tunnel** = virtual connection realized between VPN devices.

\-**Tunneling(network service does not have native encryption support)**
= sending data through the created tunnel.

-   \-**Carrier Protocol** = a lower layer protocol that ensures the
    delivery of VPN protocol packet data.
    **VPN Protocol** = the protocol used to create the tunnel.
    **Encapsulated data** = packets/frames of the original protocol, are
    transmitted through the tunnel.
