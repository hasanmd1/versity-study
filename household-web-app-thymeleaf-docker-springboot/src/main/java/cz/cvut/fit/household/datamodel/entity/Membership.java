/**
 *
 * Membership is a connection bridge between household and users, it stores basic information about current status of user in the household.
 * New instance of membership is created whenever new user joins Household {@link Household}. Every user can have multiple
 * memberships (one for every household where he is a member).
 * Membership has three possible states: ACTIVE, PENDING and DISABLED.
 * ACTIVE - you are current member of the household.
 * PENDING - you are invited to the household, but you did not accept or decline invitation yet.
 * DISABLED - you either declined invitation or left household.
